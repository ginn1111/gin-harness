# Gin-harness system — four-phase Ginflow lifecycle

## Problem

Large autonomous execution can leave humans without reliable context. Ginflow separates Discovery, Shaping, Execution, and Decision so intent, immutable execution evidence, review findings, and final human authorization remain reconstructable.

- Hermes owns profiles, runtime, tools, Kanban state, skill loading, and lifecycle.
- Ginflow core owns package vocabulary and validation model.
- `ginflow-gate` injects bounded guidance and validates evidence at native transitions.
- Target project owns product code, local rules, tests, and canonical verification.
- User approves the complete package and resolves decisions that artifacts cannot settle.

## Artifact-first flow

- Hermes owns profile/runtime identity, Kanban state and tools, assignment, dispatch, persistence, and lifecycle authority.
- Ginflow core validates versioned pure records and derives readiness, projections, and provider-neutral intent.
- `ginflow-gate` remains the completion/evidence adapter at native Hermes transitions.
- Target projects own product behavior and canonical verification.
- Adapters collect Git/check evidence, deliver gateway notifications, and later publish provider-specific merge requests.

## Four-phase Initiative lifecycle

One stable Initiative links all records. Phase metadata remains separate from Hermes physical Kanban status.

1. **Discovery** captures problem, desired outcome, constraints, non-goals, prototype evidence, vocabulary, open questions, and approved Shaping handoff. Prototype code is non-production unless explicitly promoted through Spec, Plan, Ticket, acceptance, and verification.
2. **Shaping** retains artifact-first Execution Package v2. Each Ticket declares objective, scope, exclusions, acceptance, dependencies, workspace, owner, verification, Change Group, risk, and escalation. Approval binds package revision and artifact baseline.
3. **Execution** authorizes one immutable `execution_batch` attempt per run. Authorization binds canonical package digest, baseline commit, Ticket set, isolated workspaces, budget, stop conditions, and actor claim. Existing blocked Work Unit and Integration card creation remains the dispatch seam. Integration success opens Decision; it does not complete Initiative.
4. **Decision** starts read-only. `review_cycle` stores exact commits, evidence, findings, deviations, Change Groups, coverage, risks, actor, immutable revisions, and dispositions. Human outcomes are `approved_for_mr`, `enhancement_requested`, `rejected`, `resume_execution`, `reshape_required`, or `stopped`. Only `approved_for_mr` completes Ginflow lifecycle.

Contracts: `initiative`, `execution_batch`, `review_cycle`, `decision_projection`, `notification`, and `merge_request_intent`. Initiative linkage is never inferred from titles or branches.

## Decision evidence and boundaries

Decision readiness requires immutable result state, terminal Ticket outcomes, exact baseline/result/target provenance, result-bound canonical verification, deterministic changed-path assignment to Change Groups, and evidence-backed claims. Projection order is decision required, executive context, behavior delta, Change Groups, Ticket/acceptance coverage, verification, risks/findings, choices, exact commits, and MR intent. Projections are bounded and redacted: raw logs, secrets, personal data, internal prompts, and unrestricted transcripts never enter them.

`notification` carries material `decision_ready` or `decision_blocked` events with idempotency, replay, acknowledgement, and bounded delivery state. Transport and subscription setup remain adapter-owned. TUI, direct Hermes database access, and provider-specific publication/merge remain deferred. Rejected/stopped branches and evidence are not automatically deleted.

## Authority and route boundary

| Concern | Authority |
| --- | --- |
| Identity, Kanban, cards, assignment, dispatch, persistence, lifecycle | Hermes |
| Pure contract validation, readiness, projection, notification envelope | Ginflow core |
| Native completion evidence enforcement | `ginflow-gate` |
| Git/check/scanner collection and gateway/provider adapters | Adapters |
| Product behavior and canonical verification | Target project |
| Intent and human disposition | Human operator |

All governed/autonomous work uses the four-phase Initiative lifecycle above.

## Provider-document architecture

Canonical diagram lane: bottom of page **Gin-harness system** (cells `pd-*`). Each Work Unit has one canonical **provider document** (`local`, `github`, or `linear`).

1. Setup resolves the provider from exact directives (never tool availability); conflicts or no access stop with no fallback.
2. Shaping's normalized Work Package is rendered by a pure builder (title, body, metadata, content hash); remote writes need approval.
3. An adapter creates or adopts the record (single exact metadata match only) before Hermes creates the blocked card with a concise body and document link.
4. `document_baseline`: local = Git commit + hash; remote = provider, ID, URL, hash, fresh fetch ≤ 5 minutes. Content freezes when the card runs.
5. For github/linear, mapped tracker Issue status updates before each Hermes transition (workers: start, block, resume, review-request; reviewers: request-changes, completion), then re-fetch. Missing mapping or failure fails closed.
6. `ginflow-gate` validates evidence without provider credentials; canonical project verification is still required.

Hermes Kanban remains lifecycle authority throughout. Details: [`GINFLOW-V2.md`](../specs/GINFLOW-V2.md#provider-documents), [ADR 0001](../adrs/0001-artifact-first-execution-packages.md).
