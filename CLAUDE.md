# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working in this repository.

## Repository role

Gin-harness is a Hermes Agent setup/integration repository, not a product application. It owns the shared Ginflow workflow, reusable routing/validation code, Hermes plugins, profile setup scripts, target-project templates, architecture docs, and deterministic integration tests. Target repositories own product code, local rules, product tests, and canonical product verification.

Keep this boundary intact: do not use this repository as a target-project workspace, and do not put target-project artifacts here unless the change explicitly modifies the global profile system.

## Architecture

- `skills/ginflow/` is the normative operational contract. It defines work-mode/size/risk routing, Kanban card shape and lifecycle handoff, artifact layout, startup/completion rules, and the external harness validator.
- `core/ginflow-core/` contains reusable routing and execution-package primitives. Shared logic must stay independent of Hermes runtime details where possible.
- `plugins/ginflow-gate/` integrates with native Hermes hooks and enforces governed completion evidence. It supplies bounded routing context and validates card fields, verification metadata, linked artifacts, baseline commits, and drift; Hermes remains lifecycle authority.
- `plugins/ginflow-trace/` provides optional trace logging. Tracing is off by default and writes under the target workspace's `.ginflow/` paths when enabled.
- `scripts/` owns setup, installation, profile verification, and integration-test helpers. `templates/` supplies starter target-project context and governed artifact templates.
- `docs/` holds architecture and governed repository documentation. Editable Draw.io sources and derived explanations must remain consistent.
- `core/c2c/` contains the vendored c2c CLI; run it through `make c2c C2C_ARGS="..."`.

Hermes owns profiles, tools, Kanban state, assignments, and lifecycle transitions. Ginflow supplies routing and worker guidance; `ginflow-gate` validates evidence at native transitions. A target project remains authority for product behavior and its canonical verification command.

## Workflow constraints

Load and follow `skills/ginflow/SKILL.md` for target-project startup, task shaping, execution, completion, handoff, and setup-repo versus target-repo decisions. Before mutable target-project work, require a complete selected Kanban card unless all Direct Work eligibility conditions are affirmative. Governed artifacts belong in the target repository and use the card's stable ID in their paths.

Read `INSTALL.md` before profile installation. Preserve profile-owned identity, secrets, authentication, memories, sessions, and runtime data. Do not edit generated/local state such as `.hermes/`, `.codegraph/`, `.ginflow/`, trace logs, or Python caches.

## Development commands

Run from repository root. The implementation uses Python standard library, POSIX shell tools, Make, Git, Draw.io XML, and PyYAML for checked tooling.

```bash
# Environment and optional dependency
make doctor
make doctor-deps                 # installs PyYAML only

# Static checks and canonical repository verification
make lint
make test                        # lint + core, lifecycle, plugin, and installer tests

# Individual checks
make lifecycle-test
make plugin-test
make trace-test
make install-test
python3 plugins/ginflow-gate/test_ginflow_gate.py
python3 plugins/ginflow-trace/test_ginflow_trace.py

# Setup/profile operations
make install PROFILES="<profile>"
make uninstall
make verify PROFILES="<profile>"
make verify-strict PROFILES="<profile>"

# c2c CLI
make c2c C2C_ARGS="doctor --json"

# Remove generated caches and local CodeGraph index
make clean
```

`make lint` runs `bash -n` over project shell scripts and `python3 -m py_compile` over project Python scripts. `make test` is the setup-repository check; it does not replace a target project's own canonical verification. Report target-project verification separately.

## Completion expectations

Keep diffs narrow and preserve unrelated worktree changes. For Ginflow work, record exact changed files, baseline/commit metadata, linked artifacts, verification commands/results, and blockers on the selected card. Before declaring setup-repository changes done, run `make lint && make test`; report exact failures and any checks blocked by missing external Hermes/profile context.
