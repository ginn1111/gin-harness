**Ginflow: a workflow, routing, and completion-gate layer around [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/) Kanban.** It makes autonomous agent work scoped, restartable, and evidence-backed.

> **Status: early.** Contracts are versioned `v1` and may change.

Hermes is an agent runtime with profiles and a native Kanban board. Ginflow adds shared documents, routing, and gates so a card cannot be completed without proof.

## Features

- **Four-phase lifecycle** that settles ambiguity before code is touched.
- **Provider documents**: one canonical governance record per Work Unit (local Markdown, GitHub Issue, or Linear Issue); Kanban cards stay short and link to it.
- **Completion gates** (`ginflow-gate`) check card fields, verification evidence, linked artifacts, baseline commits, and drift at native Hermes transitions.
- **Reusable core** (`core/ginflow-core/`): routing and Execution Package primitives, independent of Hermes.
- **Optional tracing** (`ginflow-trace`), off by default.

| Phase | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Discovery | Read-only problem framing: outcome, constraints, non-goals |
| Shaping | One approved, artifact-first Execution Package |
| Execution | Isolated Work Units run as Kanban cards, then an Integration card |
| Decision | Human disposition from exact evidence; only `approved_for_mr` completes the lifecycle |

Hermes stays the authority for cards, assignments, and lifecycle state. Target repositories keep their own code, rules, and canonical verification.

## Quick start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ginn1111/gin-harness/main/install.sh | bash
hermes plugins enable ginflow-gate     # then restart Hermes sessions
```

Needs `git`, `python3`, `make`, and Hermes with at least one installed profile. The installer clones to `~/.gin-harness`, installs the skill to `~/.agents/skills/ginflow`, and installs `ginflow-gate` and `ginflow-trace` into each profile. It never edits profile config, identity, secrets, or sessions.

```bash
PROFILES="a b" curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash   # limit to selected profiles
```

Full walkthrough, with a read-before-run option, update, uninstall, and troubleshooting: [docs/guides/getting-started.md](docs/guides/getting-started.md).

## Usage

In your target repository (not this one):

```bash
cp ~/.gin-harness/templates/hermes.md .hermes.md
echo .hermes.md >> .git/info/exclude
```

Set the project's canonical verification command in `.hermes.md`, open Hermes there, and run `/ginflow`. It creates `.ginflow.yaml` and walks Discovery → Shaping → Execution → Decision. Workers finish with `kanban_request_review`; `ginflow-gate` validates evidence there and at `kanban_complete`.

Minimal `.ginflow.yaml` (written for you; shown for reference):

```yaml
version: 1
ginflow:
  board: <Kanban board slug>
  workspace: /absolute/path/to/project
  worker:
    profile: <worker Hermes profile>
```

More options and the evidence rules: [docs/guides/project-config.md](docs/guides/project-config.md).

## How it works

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `skills/ginflow/` | Normative workflow contract and harness validator |
| `core/ginflow-core/` | Routing and Execution Package primitives |
| `plugins/ginflow-gate/` | Hermes hooks: routing context and completion enforcement |
| `plugins/ginflow-trace/` | Optional trace logging |
| `templates/` | Starter target-project rules and artifact templates |
| `scripts/` | Install, setup, verify, and test helpers |
